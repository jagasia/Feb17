Task:
	create a html page that contains a "div".
	The paragaphs inside this div should be displayed in multiple columns.
	
	Identify the css properties and their possible values related to columns.
	


	in css, there will be more than 1 way of styling

	ex:
		column-rule	(contains all options)
		column-rule-width	(only for column rule width)


		columns
		column-count

		column-rule: 4px double #ff00ff;	(4px is the width)
							we can specify those 3 values separately also

		column-rule-width
		column-rule-color
		column-rule-style

            column-rule: 4px double blue; 	/* this is same as below 3 lines */
            column-rule-width:5px ;
            column-rule-style: dotted;
            column-rule-color: orange;






5 group of 5 members each (1 team having 6 members)
6 group of 4 members each (2 teams having 5 members)



Create a folder like
	team1

		keep all files inside this folder or its sub folder
		all paths should be relative path
			do not use		d:\	



project folder 
	team2
		index.html
		other html files also here
		images/
			all image files

	location reference should be
		images/pic1.jpg

Javascript
----------

What is the difference between
	static and dynamic web page

	suppose i display time in my web page.	Will the time be same forever?	(at this moment, yes). With all the techniques you learned so far, 
	HTML
	CSS
			14:16 IS THE time now. But this will not change

	static web page will display information that is always same

	Dynamic means,
		if i select a country in a drop downlist, corresponding states/ provinces should be displayed in response to my user action

	user interact like clicking a button, typing something, selecting an option, etc
		if the program respond to those actions accordingly, then it is a DYNAMIC web page

	validations, we were able to give custom message. but not much of conditions
	:hover effect
	are some aspect we did in HTML, CSS 

	Dynamic web pages, respond to user interaction, produce different output based on user input
		calculation
		validation
		computation
	
	
Dynamic web pages:
	i) client side scripting
	ii) server side scripting

	script?
		program that produces output based on input

	example for scripting languages
		javascript, vbscript, servlet, JSP, ASP, PHP, etc (related to web appln)

	javascript, vbscript comes under client side script language category
	servlet, JSP, ASP, PHP	comes under server side script language category

	what it means client side and server side?
	lets understand a web application architecture

	if i am accessing facebook.com from this computer,
		this computer is called as client
		the facebook website pages like html pages, comes from a "SERVER"

	question is, Where does your program execute???????		(not where the programs are stored. the programs are always stored in the server. Facebook.com means there are lot of programs, html, css, js, etc etc) all these files are not stored in every computer in the world

	sometimes, the programs come to client machine and execute in client's computer. (They are called as client side script)

	some programs stay in server only, execute at server and produce output. The output only comes to client's browser. They are called as server side script.

	
Javascript is a client side script, (because, it is executed in the clients browser)
	ex:
		when i type password, the password strength (weak, moderate, strong) can be checked using client side script itself. NO NEED TO GO TO SERVER TO check the password strength

		BUT
		If the password is correct or not, cannot be checked at client itself. We need to check the database (which is present in the server)


	suppose, i display "time" using javascript, which time will be displayed?	(client machine's time)

	suppose, i display time using servlet, server's time will be displayed.

	there are some guidelines to decide, client side or server side script should be used.
		javascript runs in client, so it cannot access database.

	
Javascript has lot of versions
	ECMA	
		European Computer Manufacturers' Association

	ECMA Script shortly called as ES5, ES6		

	where does javascript run? it runs in browser (chrome, ie, firefox)

	whenver javascript new version comes, browsers also need to upgrade. otherwise old browsers do not understand new version of javascript.

	So to address this problem, ECMA has introduced a new language "typescript" on compilation, it will translated to javascript

------------------
javascript is not compiled language. It is interpreted. 

Javascript is an object oriented language
interfaces
constructors
overloading
overriding

declare variables
define functions
call functions

Javascript uses Document Object Model to represent the web page as an object
what is object
	properties
	function
	events			click		change 		focus

lets take a textbox
	value is a property
	id is a property
	class is a property
	show()	is a method
	hide()


function fn1()
{
	
}

DOM
	in dom, we represent the entire page as an object (document)

	document is an object that represents entire page
	using document object, we can access any of its child elements

TasK:
	var x;			// i have not assigned any value to x. now x is "undefined"


objects in javascript can be
	null			type is assigned. but value is not assigned
	undefined		type is not assigned.


Task:
	1) add 2 text boxes (no1, no2)
	2) add buttons to 
		Add
		Subtract
		Multiply
		
	while clicking these buttons, those operations should happen



TasK:
	write a javascript function that will check if the 
		password matches with confirm password or not


Task:
	Display the error message in the <div></div> (instead of alert dialog box)
	

	Javascript can access any element in a page, using DOM
		document.getElementById


	value property is used for elements which has scalar value (single value)
	But <div> is a container and hence do not have value property
		instead, use innerText property (or) innerHTML property
		
	innerText does not support HTML tags. It displays tags as text
	innerHTML process the tags and produce formatted result

	

THERE are html elements that has 
		value 
There are html elements that has
		innerText and 
		innerHTML 

	elements like
		<p></p>	
		<div>
		<span>
		<table>
		<body>
		

	these elements have innerText or innerHTML property


Task:
	text box to accept a number
		and display a multiplication table of that number (1 to 10)
	ex:
		if number is 5

		1 * 5 = 5
		2 * 5 = 10

		upto 10 * 5 = 50

	Hint:
		keep a blank <table> element in the body. Use innerHTML to write inside the <table> on button click


	A text box and a button
	for(var i=1;i<=10;i++)
	{
	
	}



in javascript, a string literal should be in 1 line only if we use single quote or double quote
but 
for multi line literal, we can use ``	(this symbol is found left side of 1 button) ie., tilde symbol, same button

var str='hello';
var str+=' world';
alert(str);			//hello world

var i=20;
i+=10;							i=i+10;
		what is i now?		30.

+= means		
	-=
	*=
	/=
	%=

a+=10		means 	a=a+10

document.write('hello world');

Operators in Java Script language:
	equality 
		==
		===

	== is used to compare the value or reference of the operands
		ex:
			var i=20;
			var j=20;
			if(i==j)			//here, the value of i and value of j are compared
		why the values are compared?	Because, i and j are value types. Number is value type

		ex:
			var d1=new Date();
			var d2=new Date();
			if(d1==dt2)			//here, the ref of d1 and ref of d2 are compared
		why the ref are compared?	Because, d1 and d2 are ref types. Objects are reference types

            var s1='hello';
            var s2='hello';
            alert(s1==s2)		//true because, s1 and s2 are same reference objects. Their memory address is same



		var s1=new String('hello');
            var s2=new String('hello');
            alert('comparing s1 and s2: '+(s1==s2));
		//false because, s1 has a new memory. 	s2 has a new memory.  Their memory addresses are different. So == returns false while comparing their references.

-----------------------------------------
what is === operator?
	
	=== compares value/ref and also the type of the operands

	this means	'is same'



when i say
	document.getElementById('password')
		this represent that textbox itself as an object

	document.getElementById('cpassword')
		this is another object

		===
	this will say false only because, though values are same (ref are different) even if ref are same, but type also is checked.

we can create one function for all button click also. so we can check if which button is clicked

------------------------------------------------
Arithmetic operators
+
-
*
/
%
**
--
++		4%5		is equal to 4
		5%4		is equal to 1
		
	we can use modulo when we want to get a number only below given no

	there are only 5 options we have	(0 to 4)

		any number %5 will return 0-4 only


x++;
++x;

There is no difference when it is the only operation in that line

var y=x++;			//here post increment has significance. Increment is postponed and assignment happens

var y=++x;			//here pre increment. so x increments first and then assignment

----------------------------------
Assignment operators:
---------------------

=
+=
-=
/=
%=
**=			x**=y		means, 		x=x**y


<<		means left shift
	5<<2	means?		binary of 5 is 101
	101 is represented as 0000 0101
	0000 0101	left shift twice	means, all 1s shift left twice
	0001 0100	20 is the answer

	left shift is like multiply by 2
	
>>
	4>>2	
		4 means?		100
				0000 0100		right shift once means divide by 2
				0000 0010	equal to 2
				0000 0001	equal to 1

int i=20;
String str=i;		//error
String str=i+"";		//easily converted it to string
String str=String.valueOf(i);	//


Activity:
	identify the operators in javascript and identify their significance
